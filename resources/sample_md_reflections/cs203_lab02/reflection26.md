- What will you do before the next meeting? We will all individually work on trying to get GatorMiner set up.
- Are there any obstacles in your way? There are some errors with trying to install gensim that are affecting a lot of people in our class.

### Scrum Meeting Two (Friday)

- What will you do before the next meeting? We will all look over the ZenHub board and make sure that we can edit it.
- Are there any obstacles in your way? Not everyone is able to access ZenHub as it is currently read-only.

### Scrum Meeting Three (Sunday

- What did you since last meeting? We looked over ZenHub and finished the set up of GatorMiner.
- What will you do before the next meeting? We will make an issue on the ZenHub board and look over the reflection for the lab.

## At a high level, what were the most important professional tasks that you completed?

- First task - Communicating with my teammates
- Second task - Asking the TL's in the slack channel for help
- Third task - Helping my teammates and other people in the class out with technical issues

## At a high level, what were the most important technical tasks that you completed?

- First task - Downloading GatorMiner
- Second task - Fixing all of the issues associated with getting gensim to work
- Third task - Getting ZenHub and the tracker to work

## After completing this week of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

I want to practice more with ZenHub, as I still am not as familiar with this project board as much as other people in my group are. This will help to better understand how to help more with our course project as we advance.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

My biggest concern is that there will be a lot of times where we won't get as much work done because there are set up issues and issues with permissions. I am also worried about all of the conflicting schedules and how that will impact the efficiency of our work.
